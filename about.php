                <h2 class="N1">Our <span class="N2">Story</span></h2>
                <p>Petties was founded in 20023 by Mr. Sharmila, who had a dream of creating a compassionate community for abandoned and surrendered pets. What started in Sharmila's home with a few foster dogs and cats quickly grew into a network of foster families across the city. Over the years, we've expanded our services to include pet adoption events, affordable vet clinics, pet supply donations, and educational resources.</p>
                
                <h2 class="N1">Our <span class="N2">Mission and Values</span></h2>
                <p>At the core of Petties is our unwavering commitment to animal welfare and responsible pet ownership. We believe that every animal deserves a safe, loving home, and we strive to educate and support pet owners throughout the entire adoption journey and beyond.</p>
                <p>Our values include compassion, integrity, and a dedication to creating a more humane world for animals. We work tirelessly to promote the adoption of rescue pets, advocating against puppy mills and irresponsible breeding practices.</p>
